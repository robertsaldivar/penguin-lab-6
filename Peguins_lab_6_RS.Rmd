```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Load packages and read-in penguins.csv data

```{r, include = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(car)
library(onewaytests)

penguins <- read_csv("penguins.csv")
```

Our question:

Is there a significant difference in mean flipper length for female penguins by species (Chinstrap, Gengtoo, and Adelie)?

2. Do some exploring 

New functions: with + table for easy counting over multiple factors

Update species name using case_when

```{r}
counts <- with(penguins, table(species, sex))

penguins2 <- penguins %>%
  mutate(common_name = 
           case_when(
             species == "Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)" ~ "Chinstrap",
             species == "Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)" ~ "Gentoo",
             species == ""
             
           ))
```
